         <p><b>Abeliophyllum (White Forsythia, or Korean Abelialeaf)</b> is a monotypic
           genus of flowering plants in the olive family, Oleaceae.<br />
           It consists of one species, <b>Abeliophyllum distichum Nakai</b>, endemic to
           Korea, where it is endangered in the wild, occurring at only seven
           sites.<br />
           It is related to Forsythia, but differs in having white, not yellow,
           flowers.
         </p>
         <p>
           It is a deciduous shrub growing to 1 to 2 m tall. The leaves are
           opposite, simple, 6 to 10 cm long and 3 to 4.5 cm wide, pubescent
           both above and below. The flowers are produced in early spring before
           the new leaves appear; they are white and fragrant, about 1 cm long,
           with a four-lobed corolla. The fruit is a round, winged samara 2 to
           3 cm diameter.
          </p>
         <p>
           It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in Europe and North America.
